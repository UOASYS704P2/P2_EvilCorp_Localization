# ProjectWorkspace
Compsys704 project2 code(embedded system code).
The main contributers of this repository are Heather and Joy.
This repository includes our mobile_devide project and base_station project.
As embedded system will generate code based on local system and hardware, it's better to submit the whole projects by one simplicity studio otherwise there will be full of conflicts which cannot be solved properly.
You can also download our compressed files which are base_station_code.zip and mobile_device_code.zip to test our projects.
