# P2_EvilCorp_Localization_System_Part1

Compsys704 Project2 Code (Embedded system part).
This repository includes two thunderboard sense projects: 1) mobile_devide project and 2) base_station project.

Running Environment: Simplicity studio v4.

How it works:
Method 1:
1)	Executing command:
git clone https://github.com/UOASYS704P2/ProjectWorkspace.git
2)	Launch Simplicity studio v4 and import base_station_code and mobile_device_code.

Method 2:
Download the compressed files: base_station_code.zip and mobile_device_code.zip to test the projects.

Due to the characteristics of simplicity studio, when building projects, the auto-generated files based on local system and hardware will cause conflicts when we pull and submit the updated code, so the whole project is submitted by one contributor kangguolong.
The main contributors of this repository are Heather and Joy.
